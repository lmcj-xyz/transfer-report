	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11026},
	abstract = {In this paper we present a scheme for the numerical solution of one-dimensional stochastic diﬀerential equations ({SDEs}) whose drift belongs to a fractional Sobolev space of negative regularity (a subspace of Schwartz distributions). We obtain a rate of convergence in a suitable L1-norm and we implement the scheme numerically. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst paper to study (and implement) numerical solutions of {SDEs} whose drift lives in a space of distributions. As a byproduct we also obtain an estimate of the convergence rate for a numerical scheme applied to {SDEs} with drift in Lp-spaces with p ∈ (1, ∞).},

	abstract = {Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations ({BSDEs}) have been widely employed in various areas of applied and financial mathematics. In particular, {BSDEs} appear extensively in the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives, stochastic optimal control problems and optimal stopping problems. Most {BSDEs} cannot be solved analytically and thus numerical methods must be applied in order to approximate their solutions. There have been many numerical methods proposed over the past few decades, for the most part, in a complex and scattered manner, with each requiring a variety of different and similar assumptions and conditions. The aim of the present paper is thus to systematically survey various numerical methods for {BSDEs}, and in particular, compare and categorise them. To this end, we focus on the core features of each method: the main assumptions, the numerical algorithm itself, key convergence properties and advantages and disadvantages, in order to provide an exhaustive up-to-date coverage of numerical methods for {BSDEs}, with insightful summaries of each and useful comparison and categorization.},

              We give a new take on the error analysis of approximations of stochastic differential equations ({SDEs}), utilizing and developing the stochastic sewing lemma of Lê (Electron J Probab 25:55, 2020.

In our first application we show convergence (to our knowledge for the first time) of the Euler–Maruyama scheme for {SDEs} driven by fractional Brownian motions with non-regular drift.
